The code run in Google Colab.
Python version: 3.7.10

Step 1:
In Big Query execute the following query:

SELECT
  user_id,
  SUM(basket) AS amountoforder,
  COUNT(user_id) AS frequency
FROM
  `bi-2019-test.ad_hoc.orders_jan2021`
GROUP BY
  user_id
ORDER BY
  frequency DESC
  
The query above returns the total value of all orders (amountoforder) 
as well as the total count of orders (frequency) for each customer.

Step 2:
Save the results of the above query in csv format with name 'grouped_data.csv' 
and upload it in Google Drive into a folder named 'efood'. 

Step 3:
Upload the efood_assessment.ipynb in Google Colab.

Step 4:
Run the first cmd of the notebook in order to mount your Drive's contents.
When you do, a link will appear, click on it, copy the link which you'll find 
and paste it in the box below the cmd. 

Ster5:
Run all the cmds in the notebook.

Note: Different runs of the code are expected to have slightly different values 
as regards the clustering results and maybe the naming of the clusters will also differ.
